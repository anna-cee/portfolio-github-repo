## Website Purpose
The purpose of this website is to present myself as an IT professional according to the brief of the assignment. However, I am at such as embryonic stage of journey into web development that rather than attempting to create site content that displays my work experience, my goal was to create a site that could a) show my competence at this point and; b) be easily updated as my expertise progresses.



## Site Functionality & Features

The design is original and simple so that it can be navigated by the viewer easily, but also so that it could be developed more easily as my knowledge increases. It displays the skills I've gathered so far in my course in HTML and CSS.

The design employs bright basic primary variations and a monochrome base. Imagery is drawn from passport/resume photo formats, complementing the overall sectional and grid design. 

Colour is used to add complexity, create depths, organise information as well as highlight important information and make the site visually impactful and cohesive.

Simple sectional layouts with layers of colour, image and blocks allow for ease of responsiveness with a high level of effectiveness. The simplicity of layout for some pages meant that for some very basic layouts, media breakpoints for tablet and phone were not required. Flexbox  and responsive CSS allowed for the screen change. Only when it got to desktop size did those simply layouts need altering.

The site has four main pages, with the fourth serving as a contents or landing page to the blog entries that can be linked to from there. Each site page has a header and footer with navigation to each page or return to homepage, making it easy to navigate to and from any page. Styling is consistent. The blog entries have their own return to blog landing page link.

- Homepage: immediate introduction with photos and text. Hover highlights draw key information out from the monochrome background as cursor moves across page, encouraging the visitor to explore the page. Contact information and links to external socials are prominently highlighted as is the site menu.


- Bio:
The bio is brief, with a simple statement of where I'm at now, and simple but stylistically impactful, with more in depth on person and profession in blog and skills respectively. 

- Skills:
4 sections with a prompt summary of skills and qualifications, and a call to action for contact or checking out external socials, Github and LinkedIn. Use of flexbox makes 4 sections dynamic across screensizes.


- Blog:
The blog page has been designed with its own landing page giving the viewer a summary of topics. Hover highlights in indicate clickable blog titles. Icons made from pictures preview the content of the blog.

-Blog Entries:
Each blog entry is styled with same css to create a cohesive subcategory, but styling and colour choices link it clearly with rest of site. At this stage blog content is primarily personal hobbies and interests but can become more professional as I develop or convey transferable knowledge and skills, as per the "Colour" entry.

-Colour Grid in CSS:
The blog entry on color features a grid I mad ein CSS using flexbox and is not a picture of a colour grid. It shows an attempt to translate learning from a new oil painting interest into graphics using the HEX values on CSS.

## Target Audience
The target audience is made up of potential employers and fellow IT professionals as per the assignment brief. In real-life use, this type of website would be equally valuable as tool for sharing my own projects, connecting and networking with other web development students.
