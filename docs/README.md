Presentation

## Website Purpose
The purpose of this website is to present myself as an IT professional according to the brief of the assignment. However, I am at such as embryonic stage of journey into web development that rather than attempting to create site content that displays my work experience, my goal was to create a site that could a) show my competence at this point and ; b) be easily updated as my expertise progresses.

The site design 

## Site Functionality & Features

The design is original and simple so that it can be navigated by th eaudience easily, but also so that it could be developed more easily as my knowledge increases.

Homepage: Everything is available on landing within a relatively small space. A clear simple introduction with a strong design sense. Direct links and prominent nav menu to children of the main page. Clear contact information with clickable links that prompt telephone or email communication or take the viewer to explore my other web presences.

Navigation:
Each site page has a header and footer with navigation to each page or return to homepage, making it easy to navifate and look around quickly.

Contact:
My contact information is also repeated in the footer. GitHub and LinkedIn icons link directly to the external sites and the telephone and email links prompt a call or open default email application to encourage ease of communication.

Bio:
The bio is brief, with nmore in depth on person and profession in blog and skills respectively.


Blog:
The blog page has been designed with its own landing page giving the viewer a summary of topics.
At this stage blog content is primarily personal but can become more professional as I develop or convey transferable knowledge and skills, as per the "Colour" entry.

Skills:
The skills page offers a short summary of skills and a link to a PDF document. 
The block design gives a brief summary in note form and the link to a PDF allows for more detail. 
The section sizing of the text blocks allows for these to me more filled out as skills, experience and qualifications  develop.

Aesthetic
The palette uses a variation of the primary triangle in contrast with monochrome. The bright, playful choices reflect my open personlaity and love of learning, whilst still anchored in the sombre tones of the monochrome. The choice of Andale Mono font and rather flat design are also reflective of a DIY aesthetic preference, also indicative of my status as a mid-life career-changer.

## Target Audience
The target audience is made up of potential employers and fellow IT professionals as per the assignment brief. In real-life use, this type of website would be equally valuable as tool for sharing my own projects, connecting and networking with other web development students.
